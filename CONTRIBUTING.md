## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

We use a **Git Flow** inspired workflow:

- **`main`**: Production-ready code, deployed to live environment
- **`dev`**: Integration branch for features, the default branch for PRs
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches (e.g., `feature/add-vic-planning-schemes`)
- **`bugfix/*`**: Bug fix branches (e.g., `bugfix/fix-qdrant-timeout`)
- **`hotfix/*`**: Urgent production fixes (merge to `main` and `dev`)

### Creating a Feature Branch

1. **Ensure you're on the latest dev**:
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   git pull upstream dev
   ```

2. **Create your feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make your changes** and commit regularly

4. **Keep your branch updated**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/dev
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Syncing with Upstream

```bash
# Fetch latest changes
git fetch upstream

# Update your dev branch
git checkout dev
git merge upstream/dev

# Rebase your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name
git rebase dev
```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)

We use **Ruff** for linting and formatting with strict settings:

#### Code Style
- **Line length**: 100 characters maximum
- **Docstrings**: Google-style for all public functions/classes
- **Type hints**: Required for all function signatures
- **Imports**: Sorted with `isort` (integrated in Ruff)

#### Running Code Quality Tools

```bash
cd backend

# Format code (automatically fixes issues)
ruff format .

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Fix auto-fixable lint issues
ruff check --fix .

# Type checking
mypy green_gov_rag tests
```

#### Example Code Style

```python
"""Module for processing environmental documents.

This module provides utilities for parsing and chunking
environmental regulation documents.
"""

from typing import List, Optional

import pandas as pd
from langchain.schema import Document


def process_document(
    document: Document,
    chunk_size: int = 1000,
    chunk_overlap: int = 200,
) -> List[Document]:
    """Process a document into smaller chunks.

    Args:
        document: The input document to process.
        chunk_size: Maximum size of each chunk in characters.
        chunk_overlap: Number of characters to overlap between chunks.

    Returns:
        A list of chunked documents with preserved metadata.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If chunk_size is less than chunk_overlap.
    """
    if chunk_size < chunk_overlap:
        raise ValueError("chunk_size must be >= chunk_overlap")
    
    # Implementation here
    chunks: List[Document] = []
    return chunks
```

### TypeScript/React (Frontend)

- **ESLint**: Airbnb style guide
- **Prettier**: 2 spaces, single quotes, trailing commas
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types

```bash
cd frontend

# Format code
npm run format

# Lint
npm run lint
```

### SQL

- Use SQLModel for database models
- Follow Alembic migration conventions
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields

---

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- **All new features** must include tests
- **Bug fixes** should include regression tests
- **Minimum coverage**: 70% overall, 90% for core RAG logic

### Test Categories

We use pytest markers to categorize tests:

```python
import pytest

@pytest.mark.unit
def test_chunk_text():
    """Test text chunking logic."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.integration
def test_qdrant_connection():
    """Test Qdrant vector store integration."""
    pass

@pytest.mark.slow
def test_full_pipeline():
    """Test complete ETL pipeline (takes >30s)."""
    pass
```

### Running Tests

```bash
cd backend

# Run all tests
pytest

# Run only unit tests
pytest -m unit

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=green_gov_rag --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_rag.py

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Writing Good Tests

```python
# Good: Descriptive name, clear assertions
def test_location_ner_extracts_sa_cities():
    """Test that NER correctly identifies South Australian cities."""
    text = "Solar farm proposed near Murray Bridge, SA"
    locations = extract_locations(text)
    
    assert len(locations) == 1
    assert locations[0].name == "Murray Bridge"
    assert locations[0].state == "SA"

# Bad: Vague name, unclear intent
def test_ner():
    result = do_stuff()
    assert result
```

### Mocking External Services

Always mock external APIs in tests:

```python
from unittest.mock import patch

@patch('green_gov_rag.rag.llm_factory.get_llm')
def test_rag_query_with_mock_llm(mock_get_llm):
    mock_llm = MockLLM(responses=["Test response"])
    mock_get_llm.return_value = mock_llm
    
    result = query_rag("test query")
    assert result.answer == "Test response"
```

### Design Patterns Used

- **Factory Pattern**: `llm_factory.py`, `vector_store_factory.py`
- **Repository Pattern**: `db_writer.py`
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI dependencies
- **Plugin System**: Document sources in `etl/sources/`

### Adding a New Document Source

1. Create `backend/green_gov_rag/etl/sources/your_source.py`:

```python
from green_gov_rag.etl.sources.base import BaseDocumentSource
from langchain.schema import Document

class YourSourceScraper(BaseDocumentSource):
    """Scraper for Your Source documents."""
    
    def fetch_documents(self) -> list[Document]:
        """Fetch documents from the source."""
        # Implementation
        pass
    
    def validate_config(self) -> None:
        """Validate source configuration."""
        required = ["url", "selector"]
        for key in required:
            if key not in self.config:
                raise ValueError(f"Missing required config: {key}")
```

2. Register in `backend/configs/documents_config.yml`:

```yaml
sources:
  - type: your_source
    enabled: true
    config:
      url: https://example.gov.au
      selector: ".document-list"
```

3. Add tests in `tests/etl/sources/test_your_source.py`

## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

#### 1. Scalable Document Source Management
**Problem**: Currently requires manual YAML editing (`documents_config.yml`) for each new document source - not scalable for growth.

**Current Limitations**:
- Manual YAML editing required for each new source
- No auto-discovery of new documents from monitored websites
- GitHub commit required to add documents
- No web UI for adding sources
- Difficult for non-technical contributors

**Proposed Solutions**:

**Option A: Database-backed Source Registry** (Quick Win)
- New table: `document_sources` (id, name, source_type, base_url, enabled, config JSONB)
- Admin API endpoints for CRUD operations: `POST /api/admin/sources`, `PUT /api/admin/sources/{id}`
- ETL reads from DB instead of YAML
- Web UI for adding/editing sources (admin dashboard)
- Migration script to import existing YAML sources

**Option B: Auto-Discovery with Scrapers**
```python
class EPAMonitor(MonitorableSource):
    """Automatically discover new EPA documents."""
    
    def discover_documents(self) -> List[DocumentMetadata]:
        # Scrape EPA website for new PDFs
        # Check if URL changed
        # Auto-detect new versions
        pass
```

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
- **Tier 1**: Critical sources - Auto-monitored with scrapers (federal legislation, state EPA, NGER)
- **Tier 2**: Standard sources - Database-backed, manually added via admin UI (council schemes, industry guidelines)
- **Tier 3**: Contributed sources - GitHub issues → automated ingestion (community contributions)

**How to Contribute**:
1. Implement `document_sources` table schema in Alembic migration
2. Create admin API endpoints in `backend/green_gov_rag/api/admin/`
3. Build React admin UI component for source management
4. Write migration script: `scripts/migrate_yaml_to_db.py`

---

#### 2. Auto-Location Extraction for Queries
**Status**: Infrastructure implemented but **DISABLED** (needs better document coverage)

**Current Implementation**:
- `HybridGeospatialSearch.search_with_auto_location()` - uses NER to extract locations
- `RAGChain.retrieve_documents(use_auto_location=True)` - passes flag through
- `QueryService` - has integration point but disabled (line 173: `use_auto_location = False`)

**Why Disabled**:
Auto-location filtering can be too narrow when document coverage is limited, resulting in empty source lists. The LLM still generates reasonable answers but without citations (trust score drops to zero).

**Auto-Location Queries** (when enabled):
```python
# User query: "What are tree clearing rules in Adelaide?"
# System auto-extracts: "Adelaide" → City of Adelaide LGA
# Results: Only documents from Adelaide LGA

# User query: "Emission rules in Port Adelaide Enfield"
# System auto-extracts: "Port Adelaide Enfield" → Port Adelaide Enfield LGA

# User query: "Building rules in NSW"
# System auto-extracts: "NSW" → New South Wales state-wide documents
```

**To Enable Later**:
When document coverage improves (>500 documents, >20 LGAs), change line 173 in `backend/green_gov_rag/api/services/query_service.py`:

```python
# Current (disabled):
use_auto_location = False

# Future (enabled):
use_auto_location = not normalized_lgas and not normalized_region
```

**Better Approach - Make Configurable**:
Add to `backend/green_gov_rag/config.py`:

```python
class Settings(BaseSettings):
    # ... existing settings ...
    
    enable_auto_location: bool = Field(
        default=False,
        description="Enable automatic location extraction from queries"
    )
    
    auto_location_min_documents: int = Field(
        default=500,
        description="Minimum documents required before enabling auto-location"
    )
```

Then in `query_service.py`:
```python
use_auto_location = (
    settings.enable_auto_location 
    and not normalized_lgas 
    and not normalized_region
)
```

**How to Contribute**:
1. Add configuration fields to `config.py`
2. Implement document count check before enabling auto-location
3. Add admin UI toggle for enabling/disabling feature
4. Write tests for edge cases (ambiguous locations, multiple matches)
5. Add metrics tracking for auto-location accuracy
